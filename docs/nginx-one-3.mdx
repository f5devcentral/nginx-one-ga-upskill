## Lab Introduction

We will give you an overview of how the NGINX One Console provides visibility into a global fleet of NGINX instances,
both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source (OSS).

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Install the NGINX Agent on both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances
- Manage and update NGINX configuration from NGINX One Console
  - Publish changes
  - Enable TLS
- Review recommendations from the NGINX One Console

## Demo

Watch me go through a [demo](nginx-one-9.mdx) where I will be adding an NGINX instance then updating the configuration
using the NGINX One Console.

## Up next

Lets now proceed to the [Interactive Lab](nginx-one-6.mdx).
